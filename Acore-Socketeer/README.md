# Acore-Socketeer
Creates an npc that allows you to exchange gold or items for a socket enchant you can put on any piece of equipment.
V1 is for item exchange with Frozen Orb set as default. V2 is money exchange for 10g as default.
In game, just .npc add 190015. Please ensure this creature id is not already taken. 
To remove the BS requirement, you'll also need  the attached dbc and to apply it to both your server dbc and mpq.
Run the SQL Query to add the creature as well.
