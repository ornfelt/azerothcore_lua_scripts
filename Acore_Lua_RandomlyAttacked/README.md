# Randomly Attacked
This script defines a few predetermined npcs that will randomly attack the player on zone updates. You can give them dialogue. Currently it's set to a 10% chance. It's best you use low level npcs, or npcs with scaling abilities, as high level npcs will use high level abilities even at lower levels. The script sets the npcs to the player's level and 1.65x the health of the player. If you use auto tune in open world then whatever. This is a great way to add a sort of pseudo world pvp feel to the game. You can also set the max number of npcs spawned at one time...just be careful with large numbers.
