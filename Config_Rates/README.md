# Config_Rates
A list of scripts that can handle experience rates, gathering rates, reputation rates and crafted item amounts. Intended for Azerothcore. Gather_Rates will absolutely not work for Trinity. Requires Eluna. Place in your lua_scripts folder. Use commands .ga .craft or .xp  in game to set rates. Can set to be gm-only or not. Feel free to adjust rates as desired. Make sure to run the Sql query in your database.
