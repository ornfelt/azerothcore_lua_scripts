# Lua-HardcoreMode
Hardcore mode implementation in lua for cores running Eluna

This creates a simple hardcore mode implementation via a token/item in the players inventory.

This item is added by talking to an NPC with listed NPC ID.

Item and NPC are created with IDS 90000 but can be easily modified to work with your setup.


1. Create new NPC with gossip flags.
2. Create an item(preferably undestroyable).
3. Change ID variables in the script to match your created IDs.




This one inspired by one of testers scripts.
