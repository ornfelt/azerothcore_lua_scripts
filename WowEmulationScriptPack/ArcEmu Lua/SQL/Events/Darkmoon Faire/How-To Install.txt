The Darkmoon Faire Project

==================================

== INTRODUCTION ==
	The Darkmoon Faire Project is a retail inspired copy of the Darkmoon Faire
	that visits three different locations around the world.. of warcraft. I rip
	all data directly from retail servers. The goal here is to make almost an
	exact replica of the official server event.

== INSTALLATION ==
	Firstly, there are two parts of this project. There are the scripts which are
	automatically compiled when using the Sun++ scripts, and there are sql files
	which you must execute on your server's world database.

== COMPILING SCRIPTS ==
	1. 	Compile the most recent version of Sun++ scripts with the most 
		recent version of ArcEmu.
	2.	You're done!
	
== INSTALLING SQL DATA ==
	1.	Browse to '../sql/Events/Darkmoon Faire/' from your Sun++ directory.
	2.	Choose a location you would like to spawn. (There are three)
	3.	In that folder are two sql files. One is a 'SettingUp' file and the
		other is an 'ActiveEvent' file. 
			- 	SETTING UP = Carnies are setting up the faire prior to it's actual 
				opening just as they do on retail.
			-	ACTIVE EVENT = The fully spawned active version of the event.
	4.	After you picked which location/series you want, just execute that sql on 
		your server's world database.
	5.	Reboot your server and you're done!
	
== REMOVING THE FAIRE ==
	1.	Browse to the location in '../Events/Darkmoon Faire/' that you currently
		have installed on your server.
	2.	In that folder open the '/Remove/' folder and execute the sql for which
		series you have installed on your world database. This has been designed to 
		not affect anything else on your server. If used with the most recent 
		revisions this should install and uninstall without any errors at all.
	3.	You are finished.
	
== IF ALL ELSE FAILS ==
	1.	Run the remove sql FIRST! (backup any data using those id if needed first)
