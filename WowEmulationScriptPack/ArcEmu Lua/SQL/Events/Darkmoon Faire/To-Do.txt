==================================
The Darkmoon Faire Project
Author: Nexis
Team: Sun++ (www.sunplusplus.info)
==================================

== SCRIPTS ==
	1. 	Tonk system is far from finished, and is currently
		commented out. Anyone want to help with this?
	2.	Sayge doesn't cast the spell he should when awarding a
		player with a Fortune.
	3. 	Setup carnies and other NPCs using the same script, bark
		all at the same time. This needs to be configured to
		generate a random hook dependent on the NPC's guid id.
		
== CREATURES ==
	1. 	The NPC text is custom because the core doesn't support 
		multiple text enties in `npc_gossip_textid`.
		
== GAME OBJECTS ==
	1. 	The cannon does not animate as it should. Any ideas anyone?
	2. 	The Darkmoon Faire Music Doodad does not currently support
		the functions needed to script it. Needs 'OnLoad' function
		added to Gameobjects in the core.
	3.	The Terokkar Forest cannon (located in Shattrath) should
		have 'Rope Line' (GO:178764) around it. Too much of a pain
		in the ass to spawn right now..
		
== QUESTS ==
	1. 	None of the quests display correctly as the core does not
		yet support 'QMGR_QUEST_REPEATABLE_FINISHED' listed in
		Quest.h which is a blue question mark, insta-finish quest
		from NPCs. They should give no quest to your quest log!
		
== WAYPOINTS ==
	1.	NPCs that walk around cannot do so in a "loop" as they
		should. This is because the `creature_spawns` table is
		out of date using a `movetype` column while the core is
		using `moverandom`.
	2.	When you speak to a walking NPC, they should stop to
		speak with you. Their 'followers' (formationlink) should
		stop with them as well.
