In Order, Start to Finish.
Mortal heroes, your victory here today was foretold long ago. My brother's anguished cry of defeat will echo across the universe, bringing renewed hope to all those who still stand against the Burning Crusade.

Talker : Velen

As the Legion's final defeat draws ever-nearer, stand proud in the knowledge that you have saved worlds without number from the flame.
Sound ID : 12516

Just as this day marks an ending, so too does it herald a new beginning...
Sound ID : 12517
Talker : Velen

The creature Entropius, whom you were forced to destroy, was once the noble naaru, M'uru. In life, M'uru channeled vast energies of Light and Hope. For a time, a misguided few sought to steal those energies... 
Sound ID : 12518
Talker : Velen

Our arrogance was unpardonable. We damned one of the most noble beings of all. We may never atone for this sin.
Sound ID : 12524
Talker : Liadrin

Then fortunate it is, that I have reclaimed the noble naaru's spark from where it fell! Where faith dwells, hope is never lost, young blood elf.
Sound ID: 12519
Talker : Velen

Can it be?
Sound ID : 12525
Talker : Liadrin

Gaze now, mortals - upon the Heat Of M'uru! Unblemished. Bathed by the light of Creation - just as it was at the Dawn.
Sound ID : 12520
Talker : Velen

In time, the light and hope held within - will rebirth more than this mere fount of power... Mayhap, they will rebirth the soul of a nation.
Sound ID : 12521
Talker : Velen

Blessed ancestors! I feel it... so much love... so much grace... there are... no words... impossible to describe...
Sound ID : 12526
Talker : Liadrin

Salvation, young one. It waits for us all.
Sound ID : 12522
Talker : Velen

Farewell...
