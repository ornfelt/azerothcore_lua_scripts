# Racial UI

* A custom UI for the Racial all races use.
each tab/Window can basically have a infinite set of spell added so a scroll bar appear at a certain point.

* The UI is made to be as simple as possible, and to be as easy to use as possible.

* Just open the client file and add the spells you want to the UI, and you are good to go. It's that simple.

## installation instructions

* Download the server, client files and put them in lua_scripts folder.
* reload the game once that's done. and it should appear a icon in-game.

new picture coming soon.
