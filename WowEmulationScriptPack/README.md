# Wow Emulation Script Pack
This is a compilation of every public script .cpp, .diff, .patch, and .lua for wow emulation. Possible the largest to ever exist and will grow.

## Reasoning
These scripts are taken from every public repository i can find the purpose of compiling them all into 1 pack.
The purpose of this is to give examples for new developers to learn from.
I highly recommend learning from these rather than just grabbing them and using them.

This is highly unorganized and a bit of a mess and that is okay. As it's meant to be a resource in a time where resources are very very sparse.
I do not maintain this repo is is just a collection.
This repo consists of over 1800 files and will continue to grow.

## Disclaimer
I do not own these scripts nor did i create them.
Using these scripts may be against their creator's lisence/terms. 
This is on you I take no responsibility as this was meant to help you learn.
