# Global Personal Bank/Mailbox/Auction House
Simple Lua Script that allows access to your character's bank, mailbox or auction house anywhere in the world via chat commands.

- While in-game, you can type "#commands" or "$commands" to display the list of available commands.

- The bank can be accessed with the following commands: ".bank", ".openbank".
- The mailbox can be accessed with the following commands: ".mail", ".mailbox".
- The auction house can be accessed with the following commands: ".auctions", ".ah", ".auctionhouse".

If you would like to add or change the commands, you can do so in the lua script.


# Setup

- Copy the "Global Mail_Banking_Auctions.lua" file into the lua_scripts folder on your server.
- If your server is already running, type ".reload eluna" in the worldserver window.  Otherwise, just start up the server.
- While in-game, prepend any of the bank, mailbox or auctionhouse commands with "!" or ".".  For example, ".bank" or "!mail".
