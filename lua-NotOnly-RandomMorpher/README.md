# lua-NotOnly-RandomMorpher
Code written in lua for Azerothcore by New-HavenWotLK(Krisande#5411)! It should also be compatible with Trinitycore!

The purpose of this lua plug and play module is to provide a morpher npc which is able to morph the player as well as the players pet (if he has one) random into another display id or to a stated display id which will be taken from a user given number.
Code is well documented which makes editing very easy =)

Have fun with the Morpher! =D
