# Mythic Plus
Mythic Plus Lua Script I've been working on. This is basically part 1. You can add specific map ids and additional multipliers for low level dungeons. Please also use my spell dbc as it's necessary to apply the correct auras. Run my sql as well. .npc add 90005 in any dungeon or raid that you'd like and select a difficulty from there.
If you just want the spell aura ids to merge with your spell dbc, they're 107077, 107078, 107079, 107080 (you'll probably want to change the icons as I use custom ones. Eventually I'll hide the auras but they're useful to see for testing purposes). This is obviously a work in progress.
