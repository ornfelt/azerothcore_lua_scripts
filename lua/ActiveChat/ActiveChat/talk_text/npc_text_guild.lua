"Super excited for my first raid! I promise not to get lost... maybe.",
"Anyone up for some casual questing this afternoon?,",
"Does anyone know why there's a statue of a gnome in the center of Stormwind?",
"I'm planning a guild fishing trip this weekend. Biggest catch wins a prize!",

"Letâ€™s work on some group achievements. Who's in for some achievement hunting?",
{"Anyone seen any good movies lately? Need something to watch while I grind.", "Just rewatched the classic 'Battle of the Dark Portal.' Never gets old."},
"Why don't rogues like to play cards? They prefer to deal in stealth!",

{"Remember when we thought 'Repair All' was a suggestion, not a necessity?", "My gold reserves remember very clearly.", "I thought it was just a fancy way to donate to the blacksmith."},

{"Just realized I've walked more in WoW this week than in real life.", "Azeroth has better scenery, to be fair."},
{"Alright team, who's ready to take on the raid tonight? And remember, it's BYOP - Bring Your Own Potions!", "I'll be there, but I'm only healing those who laugh at my jokes. So, why don't demons play hockey? Too many penalties for cross-checking!", "Count me in! Just remember, if I die, it's because I was distracted by the healer's jokes.", "I've been practicing my rotations all day, or as I like to call it, 'spinning to win.' lol", "I might be late; I'm currently stuck in stealth mode and can't find the exit button.", "Can we make a quick pit stop? My pet wants to visit the barber shop. Says he needs a trim to be more aerodynamic for the raid.", "I'll join, but only if we agree to blame all wipes on lag. And no, I'm not conjuring food for everyone again. Last time I felt like a vending machine.", "Ready for the raid! I've got my snacks, my drinks, and my cat... who's already claimed half my keyboard.", "Great enthusiasm, team! And remember, it's not about the loot... It's about the friends we /roll against along the way.", "Speaking of loot, I've implemented a new loot distribution system based on the quality of puns you bring. Start brainstorming!"},
{"Managed to sneak in some WoW during my lunch break today. Who needs food when you have quests, right?", "I hear you! Tried to explain to my cat why raid night is sacred. He just sat on my keyboard in protest."},
"Anyone else perfected the art of attending Zoom meetings with WoW on the second monitor? Asking for a friend.",
"My workout routine is sprinting from the PC to answer the door for pizza delivery. Counts as cardio, right?",
"Did you know that /gquit asks you for a confirmation now?",
{"Guys, Dominoâ€™s crust options alone make it the best pizza chain out there.",
"Papa Johnâ€™s garlic dipping sauce is a game changer. No contest.",
"Please, Pizza Hut's stuffed crust is legendary. How is this even an argument?",
"Local pizzerias always beat chains. They put actual love into their pizzas.",
"Dominoâ€™s? Really? Little Caesars has the best value for money, hands down.",
"You're all missing out if you haven't tried Marcoâ€™s Pizza. Their cheese is top-notch.",
"Pizza Hut wins just because of their pan pizza. Itâ€™s like eating a cloud.",
"Jetâ€™s Pizza deep dish is the only pizza worth talking about. That crust is everything.",
"None of you have mentioned Blaze? Fast, fresh, and you can customize every bit of it.",
"Dominoâ€™s for the win, purely based on their online ordering system. Itâ€™s 2021, folks.",
"California Pizza Kitchen is the best. They actually have unique and flavorful pizzas.",
"Have you guys even tried Papa Murphyâ€™s? Taking it home to bake is genius.",
"Papa Johnâ€™s lost its way. Dominoâ€™s for consistent quality and taste.",
"Round Table Pizza is the real king of pizza. Quality ingredients make the difference.",
"Anyone who thinks chains are better than local pizzerias has never had good pizza.",
"Little Caesars' Hot-N-Ready is the only way to go for impromptu raid nights.",
"Seriously, no love for MOD Pizza? Unlimited toppings for one price is unbeatable.",
"Cicis for the win because of the buffet. Pizza, dessert, and pasta for one low price.",
"Chuck E. Cheese... just kidding. But seriously, Dominoâ€™s for their delivery speed.",
"Pizza Hutâ€™s app and deals save our raid nights every time. Plus, their wings are decent.",
"Blaze Pizza has the best build-your-own pizza. It's like Subway but for pizza.",
"Costco pizza beats all these chains. Massive, delicious, and you can shop after eating.",
"Dominoâ€™s lava cakes push them to the top. Pizza is good, but those desserts win.",
"New York Pizzerias > Any chain. It's all about the water in the dough.",
"Guys, can we all agree that pizza is life, no matter where itâ€™s from?"},
{"Evening all! What's the plan for tonight? More raiding or something chill?",
"I vote for some battlegrounds. Could use the honor points.",
"I'm up for battlegrounds, but I also need to finish my Argent Tournament dailies.",
"How about we split up then regroup for a raid later? Best of both worlds.",
"Sounds good. I'm keen on getting some mythic dungeons done for the gear.",
"Mythic dungeons sound fun. Count me in for that.",
"Can we squeeze in a quick run through the Darkmoon Faire? I need those tickets.",
"I'm all for Darkmoon Faire. Let's meet there first, then split?",
"Perfect! After Darkmoon, I'm joining the battleground crew.",
"And I'll help anyone who needs to catch up on dailies after my mythics.",
"Looks like a plan. Darkmoon Faire, then split for battlegrounds and mythics.",
"Great. Those who want PvP, message me. We'll form the group.",
"I'll lead the Darkmoon Faire group then head to Argent Tournament. Who's with me?",
"I'll join for Darkmoon then mythics. Need that gear upgrade.",
"Mythic dungeon team, assemble! Let's chat in a separate channel for the specifics.",
"Agreed, let's coordinate on the mythic strategy.",
"Darkmoon first, then I might join the mythic team. Need to balance fun and progress!",
"Darkmoon Faire for me, then I'll see where the night takes me. Probably end up in battlegrounds.",
"PvP is calling my name. I'll be at Darkmoon but only for the essentials.",
"I'll start with mythics, then help with dailies. Anyone needing assistance, let me know.",
"Awesome! Looks like we're all set. Let's meet at Darkmoon Faire in 15?",
"See you all there. Let's make this an epic night!",
"Absolutely! Looking forward to it.",
"Epic indeed. Let's rack up those achievements.",
"Ready for action! Let's make it count, team."},
{"Clearly, Rogues are top DPS. Their burst damage is unmatched.",
"Mages, hands down. Have you seen a Fireball crit lately?",
"Hunters excel at DPS without even trying. Plus, pet aggro management is a bonus.",
"Warlocks bring not just damage but incredible utility. Soulstones, anyone?",
"Frost DKs. Have you even seen their AoE damage in ICC?",
"Shadow Priests are the dark horse of DPS. Their sustain is incredible.",
"Retribution Paladins bring the light... and the DPS. They're not just for healing.",
"Elemental Shamans can literally call down the thunder. That's top DPS material.",
"Warrior Fury spec is where it's at. Their rage fuels their damage.",
"Anyone ignoring the DPS of a well-played Balance Druid is making a huge mistake.",
"Rogues might be good, but they're nothing compared to a Mage's control and burst.",
"Hunters are just glorified bag holders. Real DPS comes from a Warlock's chaos.",
"Let's not forget Enhancement Shamans. They melee, they cast, they do it all.",
"Death Knights have been top tier since they were introduced. No contest.",
"Fire Mage has been king since Molten Core. Nothing's changed.",
"Affliction Warlocks. It's like death by a thousand cuts, but faster.",
"Survival Hunters, mark my words. Their utility and DPS are unmatched.",
"Shadow Priest, when played right, can out-DPS most classes easily.",
"Rogues are all about that sneaky, peaky damage. Can't beat the classics.",
"Warriors are literally weapons of mass destruction. Fury all the way.",
"Elemental Shaman here. Ever been hit by a lightning bolt? Exactly.",
"Balance Druids. We're not just tree huggers. Our Starfire says hi.",
"Mages are just glass cannons. Real DPS knows how to take a hit and keep going.",
"Ret Paladins bring the pain. We're not just a pretty face with a hammer.",
"Death Knight's ability to sustain and deal damage is unparalleled.",
"Affliction Warlock. Our dots make the most hardened tanks cry.",
"Enhancement Shamans smash face. Literally, with stormstrike.",
"Frost DKs in Wrath era are like a blizzard. Everything just dies.",
"Never underestimate a Survival Hunter. We're the Swiss army knife of DPS.",
"Pure DPS? It's got to be Fury Warriors. They live to smash."},
