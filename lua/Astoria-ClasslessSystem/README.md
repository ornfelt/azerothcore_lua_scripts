  <h3 align="center">AstoriaCore Classless System</h3>

## About

This is the Classless system that Project Astoria used until near the end. It is an open source classless system from an 
Ac-Web.org user, but it was very outdated and had several security holes. We fixed all those security holes (which we 
knew about) and restructured the code a bit. We also extended the system even further and gave it a completely new UI.

## Supported Gameversions

The AstoriaCore Classless System is coded for Game Version: `3.3.5a`
