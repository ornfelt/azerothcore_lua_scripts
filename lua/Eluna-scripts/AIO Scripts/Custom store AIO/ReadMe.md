# Custom Store System

This is a custom store system for the AIO Scripts. It is a simple system that allows you to add your own custom store items to the AIO Scripts. This is a very simple system that is easy to use and understand. Still being worked on, but it is functional. Will update the UI in the future. 

## Installation instructions

* Download the server files and put them in lua_scripts folder. Example: lua_scripts\AIO_Server\CustomStore
* Open the client file and add your own custom store items.
* Reload the game once that's done. It will appear in the store.
