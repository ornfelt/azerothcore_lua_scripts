    --Lore explaining away prestige in-world
    prestigeDescription = [[
    In the vast weave of time, there are countless realities where your character made different choices.

    Perhaps a Troll warrior learned the secrets of the Light, or a Tauren mage studied the mysteries of the arcane.

    The Prestige System lets you tap into these echoes of alternate timelines, drawing from destinies you never walked.. but could have.

    The Bronze Dragonflight has safeguarded these echoes, and now, with the timelines becoming increasingly unstable, weâ€™ve made these echoes accessible.. with a cost, of course.

    To Prestige is to reset your journey through time, returning to your youth while retaining special memories in the form of unique spells, chosen from other realities.
