Code written in LUA by New-Haven Wotlk+ (Krisande#5411)

The code provides you with a very well documented template for an item upgrader!
At the moment it is setted up for t4 to t5 swap on mages as well as for a single item to show you how to accomplish the rest! =)

Wish you fun with the Template!
