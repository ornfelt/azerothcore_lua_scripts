Buffer script written in lua by New-HavenWotlk(Krisande#5411) for Azerothcore (probably will also work on Trinitycore)!

This Buffer NPC script provides you unlike others with a buffer which is able to buff more than 6 buffs to the player!!!
It will also buff up your pet of course! =D

The name of the buffer "Arnold Buffenegger" is dedicated to Arnold Schwarzenegger... the Styrian Oak! =D

Code is well documented which makes editing pretty easy!

Have fun with it! =)
