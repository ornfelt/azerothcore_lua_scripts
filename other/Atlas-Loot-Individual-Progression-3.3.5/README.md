# Naxx40 and Onyxia40 Loot Tables Restoration for WoW 3.3.5

This repository contains the restored loot tables for Naxxramas 40-man and Onyxia's Lair 40-man for World of Warcraft private servers that progress through Vanilla, The Burning Crusade, and Wrath of the Lich King (3.3.5). The project aims to provide a classic experience for players by reintroducing original loot distributions for these iconic raids.

Loot that was originally from Onyxia has also been removed from Nefarian's drop tables to maintain the authenticity of the loot distribution.
